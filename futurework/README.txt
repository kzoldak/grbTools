I tried really hard to make an Energetics class to calculation Flux, Fluence, and Eiso, and be able to handle all spectral modeling programs. I was unsuccessful. For now, I kept the general 'calc_flux', 'calc_fluence', and 'calc_eiso' functions in the grbTools directory. Within the xspec and rmfit directories, there are files specific to those programs. Those should only be used when reading from an rmfit or xspec FITS file.
